## Needs attention

- **R-001** [proposed] Two-lane search beats the unseeded baseline on a fresh pool seed
  - USER decides: `python scripts/research.py approve R-001` or `reject R-001 --reason ...`
- **R-002** [proposed] The gpt-6.1-sol zero-success baseline is model, not draw
  - USER decides: `python scripts/research.py approve R-002` or `reject R-002 --reason ...`
- **R-003** [proposed] Rotating the development screen removes selection on fixed cases
  - USER decides: `python scripts/research.py approve R-003` or `reject R-003 --reason ...`
- **R-004** [proposed] Replicate bundles that vary the data give independent fitting replicates
  - USER decides: `python scripts/research.py approve R-004` or `reject R-004 --reason ...`

## Last 5 decisions

- none yet

## Standing constraints

- LLM model for every pipeline call is gpt-6.1-sol with reasoning_effort high and temperature 1 (the only temperature the model accepts). _(CLAUDE.md, decided 2026-10-13)_
- Validation (imitation) loss correlates with development success at +0.19, the wrong sign; selecting on loss cannot work. Behavioural cloning is non-monotonic in gradient steps: success peaks near 1000 steps and is zero by 3000. _(RESEARCH_HANDOFF.md, Phase 5)_
- Imitation fitting is disabled by default (bc_steps 0). If fitting is turned on it must be rollout-selected on a probe manifest disjoint from the screen; fixed-budget fitting is harmful. _(Stage E, logs/stage_e/20260914_032500; config/run_full_evolution.yaml)_
- Promotion requires a strictly positive paired success difference whose paired t interval lower bound is above zero on the promotion set (development cases 10-39). Tied success never promotes. _(lares/eval/promotion.py, decided 2026-09-14)_
- The saved incumbent scores 0.000 success on the development manifest, not 0.30. _(RESEARCH_HANDOFF.md, 'The incumbent does not reproduce')_
- Only the five fittable_seed structures (simple_reach_push_sharp_gate, simple_damped_push, simple_reach_push, simple_reach_push_damped, simple_reach_push_shared_gain) may be fittable-lane parents; the standoff family is a non-fittable control or retired. _(config/fittable_bank/structure_roles.yaml)_
- Stage F: no correction-LLM repair arm beat no_repair; search arms led, LLM arms were flat. _(RESEARCH_HANDOFF.md 'Stage F: correction-LLM repair does not beat no repair (2026-10-13)')_
- The gpt-6.1-sol baseline rerun (nine unseeded zero-shot candidates) reached zero success; the gpt-5.6-sol run of the same config reached 0.333 on the promotion set. _(logs/baseline_gpt61_sol_high, logs/baseline_gpt56_sol_high; RESEARCH_HANDOFF.md 2026-10-13)_
- The AC-6 repair ablation did not support the repair loop: optimizer-only 0.650 vs full loop 0.517 held-out success over six replicates. _(RESEARCH_HANDOFF.md, 'The repair ablation (AC-6, E6, E9)')_
- The final-test split (config/manifests/push-v2_final_test.yaml) is locked until Phase 7, which needs the user's approval and a FreezeRecord. Qwen/E10 is also blocked. _(lares/eval/freeze.py; CLAUDE.md)_
- Seeds 2400-2424 are held for config/fittable_bank/qualification_v2.yaml (predeclared, not run). New protocols pick seeds from 2600 upward. _(config/experiment_seed_ledger.jsonl; CLAUDE.md)_
- Every protocol runs on the remote GPU box via `gpu run`, which bills by the hour; the implementer stops it afterwards. Live LLM or GPU spend needs the user's per-idea approval. _(CLAUDE.md, 'Remote GPU server')_
- Spent seeds: [0, 1, 2, 1000, 1001, 1002, 2000, 2100, 2200, 2201, 2202, 2203, 2204, 2300, 2301, 2302, 2303, 2304, 2500, 2501, 2502, 3000, 3001]
